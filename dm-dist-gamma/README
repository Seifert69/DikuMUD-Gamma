To compile the game, just type 'make', and cross your fingers. So far, the game
has been successfully ported to these machines:

VAX 11/785      - Unix-BSD 4.3 (it was written on one of these babies)
Sun 4           - Unix
Sun 3 (I think) - Unix

See doc/running.doc for some hints on how to run the game - and try 'wizhelp'
in the game itself.

If you run into trouble whilst compiling or running the game, we'll be happy
to try and help you out. Send email to:
