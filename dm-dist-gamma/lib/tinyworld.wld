from seeing far in any direction save north, where a broad lane leads off into
the distance; and west, where the same lane continues towards what looks like
a fairly large city. The muted sounds of city commotion reach your ears from a
distance; stray dogs barking, children crying, and street salesmen shouting.

Redferne's Library~
This is truly a magnificent place! Books and scrolls lie together on every
shelf. A large globe, with the map of the Mud-world upon it, stands in the
dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
looking leather arm-chairs adourn the center of the library together with
a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the
west wall.

The trash dump~
   You are standing knee-deep in a pile of assorted debris, cardboard- 
like scraps and needle-like bits of bent metal. The room is in fact a

is a noticeable layer of fine dust covering everything here. The 
grey-painted walls are flaking, revealing more of the glass-like 
material that also covers the ground above. There is a wide crack in

The matrix fault~
   You are standing on the bottom of a wide crack in the matrix, going 
north and south. The sides of the fault are alive with writhing 
worm-like things, snaking out from the cracked glass, sparking madly.
To your west, a pile of great slabs of glass has fallen into a jumble 
beside the wall. They are much too large and sharp-edged for you to 
lose your precious fingers on! To the south, there is at least four 
yards between the furthest reaches of the worm-like strands, but to the 
north, the crack narrows to a point where it is impossible to pass.
