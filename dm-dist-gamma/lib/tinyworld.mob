as if searching for something, occasionally getting down to one knee,
making strange passes in the air, then picking up pieces of the ground 
that are apparently not so solid now. He is carrying a leather satchel 
over the shoulder, into which he sometimes place some of the pieces. At
his belt hangs a strange, bluish whip
When ne notices your intense scrutiny, he looks at you coldly, until you
