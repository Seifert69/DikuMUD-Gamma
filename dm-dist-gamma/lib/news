                      THE DIKUMUD HERALD - Thu Dec 15, 1990

From now on, new players will no longer enter the game as 'the Woman', or the
'the Man'. Instead, they'll enter theh game as genuine players, ready to take
on the world. We'll no longer try to keep players from having more than one
character registered - HOWEVER: We do NOT want people to play more than one
character at the time! If we catch someone doing this, we'll... we'll, er...
anyhow, it's gonna hurt - don't do it. It's considered cheating, and will be
treated as such.

P.S. If you find any errors or things that would need a fix, please tell us!

     You can use the commands 'bug', 'typo', and 'idea' for this. Or, for
     longer suggestions, etc:

We hereby declare DikuMUD free of bugs.
