SHOPS
Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

We strongly disencourage killing of other players, but the choice is yours.

must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"

LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This could be
very dangerous to your healt in the middle of a combat. But we have worked
out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution we
    can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.
